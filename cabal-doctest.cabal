synopsis:           A Setup.hs helper for running doctests
description:
  As of now (end of 2021), there isn't @cabal doctest@
  command. Yet, to properly work, @doctest@ needs plenty of configuration.
  This library provides the common bits for writing a custom @Setup.hs@.

    -- NOTE: contrary to PVP, some upper-bounds are intentionally set to major-major.
    -- This is to increase signal-to-noise ratio of CI failures. "Too tight bounds"
    -- is an extremely boring (and practically guaranteed, repeatedly) failure mode.
    -- OTOH, genuine build failures due to breaking changes in dependencies are:
    --  1) unlikely to occur, as this package is so small, moreso regularly;
    --  2) best caught in CI pipelines that don't induce alert fatigue.
    -- In any case, revisions may set tighter bounds afterwards, if exceptional
    -- circumstances would warrant that.
